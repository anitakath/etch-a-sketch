# Etch-A-Sketch

This is my first interactive project developed with JavaScript, allowing users to draw by hovering the mouse over the browser. HTML elements are dynamically created using event listeners. I also used CSS Grid dynamically for the first time.

## Installation

To clone this project from GitHub, simply run the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/dein-benutzername/etch-a-sketch.git

## Usage

If you want to draw randomly, this project is perfect for you!
